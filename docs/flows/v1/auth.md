# Authorization

:::caution
Your credentials are only yours, belo will never ask them in any way and encourages to not share them with anybody
:::

:::danger
An insecure storage of credentials will potentially result in loss of funds
:::

The usual authorization flow in the mobile app is by a deep link sent to your email,
given this does not work programmatically you will need to use another method.

You can access your account credentials creating an API key (TBD...)

You can create up to 10 API keys
