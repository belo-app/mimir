A few weeks ago, we celebrated our first year in the market. With our mobile app, developed in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), working really well in its version 0.18.6.

What our users did not know was that we had been working in our version 1.0.0, which has several redesigns all over the app, developed with React Native from scratch.

Why did we decide to migrate and to do the whole app again if everything seems to be working well?

## Reasons

### 1- The scarcity of Flutter devs

A lot of companies and great StartUps are using Flutter to create their own mobile apps, thats a fact. On the other hand, there aren’t so many developers with experience using Dart as there are in Javascript.

Obviously, this make Flutter Devs much more expensive.

Also, a developer who has 0 experience working with React Native, but has using React, can quickly adapt to this new framework because of the similarity.

So, you have more developers in React + React Native than in Flutter, and you can use them in any web development you need in the future. Flutter devs are not able to do this (Flutter web is very unstable and has SEO problems).

This last point is really important as we are working in a new API as a Service product, which needs the development of a web app for the dashboard.

### 2- A programing language is more useful if more devs are using it

The scarcity is not only a problem because make devs more expensive. As more devs are using a language, easier is to developed with it, more libraries are created and the core team iterates more quickly with the help of the community.

This last point is also important. You could need to use a OS feature that has been launched in the last versions. So, you need the framework’s core team to implement it as fast as possible.

### 3- Flutter has some risk because is created and mantained by google

If you enter to [Killed by Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/), you will find all the projects Google has deprecated with the pass of the years. 

You will also find AngularJS right there.

It’s real that Google is using Flutter in the GooglePay mobile app, and probably they are not going to deprecate flutter for this and other reasons.

But you are never sure, because GPay is not Google’s core business.

On the other hand, Facebook is using React and React Native for Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp. So you can be sure that Facebook will be supporting it for a long time.

## Final

So, these are the reasons why we decided to migrate belo’s mobile app. Remember we are always looking for new great additions to our engineering team at belo. In case you are interested to build the next generation of finance, [tell us about you here.](https://work.belo.app)
